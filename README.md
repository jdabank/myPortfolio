# myPortfolio
My portfolio website and any documentation.

I want my home page to just be a picture with my name over it and "Software Developer"

I want a top nav bar in the right or left (I have to test) with a hamburger icon, to open up to:
About
Resume
Projects
Contact
Other Work(?)

Other Work could potentially have something called "take a walk," where I show my photo series and I can click on the Google Maps links.
