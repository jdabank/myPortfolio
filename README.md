# myPortfolio
My portfolio website and any documentation.

I want my home page to just be a picture with my name over it and "Software Developer"

<<<<<<< HEAD
I want a top nav bar in the right or left (I have to test) with a hamburger icon, to open up to:
About
Resume
Projects
Contact
Other Work(?)

Other Work could potentially have something called "take a walk," where I show my photo series and I can click on the Google Maps links.
=======
My top nav bar is stuck to the page and changes for legibility no matter where you are.
I decided to put everything on one page, with a scroll - I initially tried to do this in jQuery, but it made more sense to do it in CSS.

I also changed the color of some other links.

I added an image carousel to the projects part - because my only project is the site, I just added some of my photography. The button cycles it. Reading through the corgi exercise helped me understand how to make it work with just one button.

P.S. hope you like my pictures!

I added an alert to contact if you click the link - a lot of frustration can be saved this way.
You wouldn't negotiate your price for a dinner out with the chef, right?

I think everything looks better on one page. I also added some animations because they looked fun, even though they aren't that useful. I think they look cool!

I changed the nav bar in media queries, and aligned everything to the center when the page shrinks to a certain point.
